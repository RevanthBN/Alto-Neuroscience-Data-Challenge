#### **Inspiration**

Based on an initial understanding of the dataset, it is evident that a lot of questions can be posed and understood using the given dataset and I believe some of it comes from the questions which the dataset itself poses - 

* How does the frequency of mental health illness and attitudes towards mental health vary by geographic location?
`
* What are the strongest predictors of mental health illness or certain attitudes towards mental health in the workplace?

I think this would be a good start to do some exploratory data analysis on the dataset. On a side note, I also felt like a couple more questions can be helpful in understanding Mental Health in tech workspace. On a more formal note, I would like to select the following questions and work on them:

#### **Problem Formulation**


1.   **Prediction of whether somebody needs treatment based on what they fill into the survey.** On a deeper level, the is to understand what factors are the best for predicting someone's mental health and understanding if a similar survey or questionnaire can be used again to guage somebody's mental health, expecially in the workforce domain and be able to offer them the right help. 

2.   **Correlation among various factors, to see which combination is most relevant to understand what factors have the most correlation with the need for treatment.** In here I am trying to club factors (or rather features like **work-culture - combination of tech vs non-tech, remote vs in-person, size of the company and openess about mental health**, how **age, sex and family history** ) that could give a better understanding of the mental health stats of a person. 

#### **Approach**

Having chosen the above questions to explore or to solve, I think I would take more of a scholastic approach to the problem. I intend to do it in the following steps:

##### **Common Steps:**
- Load the data from the Kaggle dataset
- Initial exploratory analysis of the data
- Data Preperation and cleaning to remove any anomalies
- Understanding intrinsic statistical trends - no ML
- Feature Engineering
- Train - Validation - Test split
- Feature Selection using Cross-correlation

##### **Problem - 1 - Approach**
- Feature Ranking using Importance techniques
- Deploy ML Models for predicting the need for treatment
- Evaluate the models and choose the best one
- Final testing of the model on the test data

##### **Problem - 2 - Approach**
- Work Culture - Feature Selection
- Correlation between features on a heatmap
